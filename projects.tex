  Fluoroscopy Simulator – Medical College of Wisconsin & September 2019 – May 2020
\end{tabular*}
\begin{bulletlist}
    \item{
        Created UI mockups detailing the user workflow and consulted with UX professors and application users to
        iterate on the design prior to starting development work on the application.
    }
    \item{
        Architected the full-stack web application solution based on requirement gathering sessions with the product
        owner and other stakeholders, improving on the original POC developed prior to our team’s involvement.
    }
    \item{
        Researched image analysis techniques using OpenCV, documenting the process in Jupyter notebooks.
        Viable options were produced to calculate the distance between two points in 3D space and returning the
        image to the client as a static image.
    }
\end{bulletlist}

\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{l@{\extracolsep{\fill}}r}
    At The Control – FIRST Robotics Streaming Site & September 2015 – August 2017
\end{tabular*}
\begin{bulletlist}
    \item{
        Created and altered database tables to store data obtained from the FRC Events API to minimize the update
        requests made and allow users to see real-time event updates for live matches.
    }
    \item{
        Trained new members to have basic web client-server understanding, allowing them to independently
        contribute to the project with newly gained skills and comprehension.
    }
    \item{
        Designed a new application architecture with industry mentors to improve performance and maintainability.
    }
\end{bulletlist}
